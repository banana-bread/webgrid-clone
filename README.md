# Webgrid Game Clone

This is a clone of Neuralink's Webgrid game, developed to measure the effectiveness of human BCI cursor control. This project is built for fun and educational purposes.

## About

The Webgrid game clone replicates the functionality of Neuralink's original Webgrid game. It is designed to provide a similar experience, allowing users to interact with a grid-based interface and test their cursor control precision.

## Development Status

**Note:** Both the `README` and the game itself are in active development. This project is currently a work in progress, and new features, improvements, and documentation updates will follow.
